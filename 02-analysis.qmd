## Goals of this notebook

::: callout-important
This analysis is through the Fall 2024 data release by the [MLSPA](https://mlsplayers.org/resources/salary-guide).
:::

We'll explore MLS Salaries through history. We'll start with the most recent data, then look back historically. A couple of questions that come to mind:

- Which players are getting paid the most this year?
- Which teams have the highest salary bill this year?
- How do team salary rankings compare over time?

[Per the MLS Player's Association](https://mlsplayers.org/resources/salary-guide), "compensation" is: The Annual Average Guaranteed Compensation (Guaranteed Comp) number includes a player's base salary and all signing and guaranteed bonuses annualized over the term of the player's contract, including option years.

## Setup

```{r}
#| label: setup
#| echo: true
#| results: hide
#| message: false
#| warning: false

library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(scales)
library(ggrepel)
library(DT)

options(dplyr.summarise.inform = FALSE)
```


## Import

### Cleaned salary data

```{r}
salaries <- read_rds("data-processed/mls-salaries.rds")

salaries |> glimpse()
```

### Team colors data

You can see in [MLS colors](99-mls-colors.qmd) how I manually built these colors (and why).

```{r}
# download.file("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQqXJxbbrBsikirZrGyXYV_G6cFZp_dYmcf52UfSYM7Kw3akGlkO5jKP8ZL8WtRA5qUJgFMNPG8JYov/pub?output=csv&&gid=1348329208", "data-processed/clubs-colors.csv")

mls_colors_data <- read_csv("data-processed/clubs-colors.csv")

mls_colors_data |> glimpse()
```

### Setting the most recent year of data

I'm creating an object called `recent_year` because at some point I'll have new data and might want to just change the year.

```{r}
recent_year <- "2024"
```


## Players with highest salaries

### Over all time

A searchable table of all players, all time.

```{r}
sal_high <- salaries |> 
  arrange(compensation |> desc()) |> 
  select(!c(club_long, conference))

sal_high |> datatable()
```

#### Data takeaway: Messi money

Upon his signing on July 15, 2023, Lionel Messi became the highest paid player in the history of the MLS with a total compensation of \$20.4 million. Lorenzo Insigne of Toronto was second at \$15.5 million, the only other player earning more than $10 million within a year.

### In most recent year

```{r}
sal_high_recent <- salaries |> 
  filter(year == recent_year) |> 
  mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(compensation))) |> 
  relocate(rank) |> 
  arrange(compensation |> desc()) |> 
  select(!c(club_long, conference))

sal_high_recent
```

Teams with more than one player from top 10

```{r}
sal_high_recent |> 
  filter(rank <= 10) |> 
  count(club_short, sort = T) |> 
  filter(n > 1)
```

#### Data takeaway: Driussi 4th in  2024

In the final salary release in 2024, Austin FC's Sebasti√°n Driussi was the 4th highest player in the MLS and Houston's Hector Herrera is the 7th highest-paid player.

Both Inter Miami and Toronto FC have two top 10 earners on their rosters.

### Difference with just base pay in 2024?

This looks at just the base salary as opposed to total compensation. No great changes at the top of the list.

```{r}
sal_high_base <- salaries |> 
  arrange(base_salary |> desc()) |> 
  select(!c(club_long, conference, compensation))

sal_high_base |> filter(year == recent_year, base_salary >= 2000000) 
```


## Team salaries

We'll get per-year salaries by team, then look at just this year.

### Highest team salaries over time

First get the total compensation for each team in each year.

```{r}
sal_team <- salaries |> 
  group_by(year, club_long) |> 
  summarise(total_compensation = sum(compensation)) |> 
  arrange(total_compensation |> desc())

# peek at the top
sal_team |> filter(total_compensation > 20000000)
```

Then find the top team for each year.

```{r}
#| message: false
top_sal_team_yr <- salaries |> 
  group_by(year, club_long) |> 
  summarise(total_compensation = sum(compensation)) |> 
  slice_max(total_compensation)

top_sal_team_yr
```

And note how often the teams have been the top spender.

```{r}
top_sal_team_yr |> 
  ungroup() |> 
  tabyl(club_long) |> 
  adorn_totals("row") |>
  adorn_pct_formatting() |> 
  as_tibble()
```

#### Data takeaways: Toronto historically spends high

Looking at the most expensive rosters in the MLS of time, Toronto FC has six of the top 10 highest entries. Over the past 17 years, Toronto has been the top spending team seven times, or 40% of the time. The L.A. Galaxy is next with five highest-spending years.

### Highest salaries this year

And let's look at this year.

```{r}
sal_team_recent <- sal_team |> filter(year == recent_year)

# peek
sal_team_recent |> head(10)
```

#### Prep data for chart

Let's round the numbers for our chart.

```{r}
sal_team_recent_mil <- sal_team_recent |> 
  mutate(total_millions = (total_compensation / 1000000) |> round(1)) |> 
  left_join(
    mls_colors_data |> select(club_long, favored_color, favored_nohex),
    join_by(club_long)
  ) |>
  drop_na(favored_color)

sal_team_recent_mil
```

#### Let's chart this

```{r}
#| label: fig-2024-team-salary
#| fig-cap: "Messi drives Miami team salary"
#| fig-alt: "Bar chart showing MLS team salaries from highest to lowest. Inter Miami and Toronto FC top the list."

sal_team_recent_mil_plot <- sal_team_recent_mil |> 
  ggplot(aes(
    x = total_compensation,
    y = club_long |> reorder(total_compensation)
  )) +
  geom_col(fill = sal_team_recent_mil$favored_color) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = label_dollar(scale_cut = cut_long_scale()),
                     limits = c(0,45000000)) +
  # geom_text(aes(label = paste("$", as.character(total_millions), sep = "")), color = "black", hjust = -.25) +
  labs(
    x = "Total team spending in $ millions",
    y = "",
    title = "Messi makes Miami top MLS spender in 2024",
    subtitle = str_wrap("Salaries includes each player's base salary plus all signing and guaranteed bonuses annualized over the term of the player's contract, including option years. San Diego FC won't play until the 2025 season."),
    caption = "By: Christian McDonald. Source: Major League Soccer Players Association"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

ggsave("figures/team-salary-2024.png", width = 7, height = 7)


```


![](figures/team-salary-2024.png)

One more look to see how many high-paid players on each team.

```{r}
sal_high_recent |> 
  filter(compensation >= 5000000) |> 
  count(club_short, sort = T)
```

#### Data Takeaway: Miami, Toronto tops

Given the historic signing of Lionel Messi in 2023, it is no surprise that Inter Miami have the highest team salary for the 2024 season. Toronto ranks second on the power of having two players making over $5 million, Lorenzo Insigne and Federico Bernardeschi.


### Team spending over time

Let's look at team spending over the past five years. To do this, we have to create a ranking for the spending.

- I'm removing players not affiliated with teams
- When I added a third column to the group because I wanted to use long names for something, the ranking broke. I had to break the group then use the `.by` argument for `rank()`.


```{r}
sal_team_rank <- salaries |> 
  filter(club_short != "MLS" | club_short |> is.na()) |> 
  group_by(year, club_short, club_long) |> 
  summarise(
    total_comp = sum(compensation, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) |> 
  arrange(year, total_comp |> desc()) |> 
  ungroup() |> #<1>
  mutate(rank = rank(-total_comp), .by = year) #<2>

# peek
sal_team_rank |> head(20)
```

1. I break the `group_by` here.
2. Then I set the ranking to work by year.

Visualizing all of them would be tricky. Let's do the top five over last five years.

```{r}
sal_team_rank_top <- sal_team_rank |> 
  filter(rank <= 5,
         year >= (as.numeric(recent_year) - 4)) |> 
  left_join(mls_colors_data |> select(club_short, favored_color, favored_nohex), join_by(club_short))

sal_team_rank_top |> 
  filter(club_short == "MIA")
```

Peek at this a different way

```{r}
sal_team_rank_top |> 
  select(-total_comp) |> 
  pivot_wider(names_from = year, values_from = rank)
```

### Let's visualze spending rank

We are using 


```{r}
#| label: chart_rank_t5

sal_team_rank_top_plot <- sal_team_rank_top |> 
  ggplot(aes(x=year, y=rank, color = favored_color, group = club_short)) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_y_reverse() +
  scale_color_identity(aes(color = favored_color)) +
  geom_label_repel(aes(label = club_short), color = "black", size = 3) +
  labs(
    title = "Miami's spending was increasing before Messi",
subtitle = str_wrap("Maimi and the L.A. Galaxy are the only MLS teams to rank as a top five spender in each of the past five years. Miami's spending rank was climbing before Lionel Messi joined in 2023."),
    color = "Club",
    x = NULL,
    y = "Spending Rank",
    caption = "By: Christian McDonald. Source: Major League Soccer Players Association"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()


ggsave("figures/sal_team_rank.png")
```

![](figures/sal_team_rank.png)

Let's count how many times each team is in this list.

```{r}
sal_team_rank_top |> 
  count(club_long, sort = T)
```


#### Data Takeaway: Miami and LA 

Both Miami and the LA Galaxy have been among the top spending teams over the past five years. Toronto FC have been top spenders in four of the last five years.
