## About this notebook

::: callout-warning
Not really using this notebook
:::


The goal here is to convert all the PDF-based salary tables to data. Some packages we'll explore:

- [pdftools](https://docs.ropensci.org/pdftools/)
- [tabulizer](https://docs.ropensci.org/tabulizer/)

The data was downloaded from the [MLS Players Association](https://mlsplayers.org/resources/salary-guide)

I have not been able to install tabulizer. I've also found some of the historical data from Data is Plural, so I'm going to us other methods.

## Setup

#| label: setup

## Conversion attempt
