## About this notebook

The goal here is to convert a number of PDF tables to data. Some packages we'll explore:

- [pdftools](https://docs.ropensci.org/pdftools/)
- [tabulizer](https://docs.ropensci.org/tabulizer/)

The data was downloaded from the [MLS Players Association](https://mlsplayers.org/resources/salary-guide)

I have not been able to install tabluizer. I've also found some of the historical data from Data is Plural, so I'm going to us other methods.

## Setup

```{r}
#| label: setup

library(tidyverse)
library(pdftools)
# library(tabulizer)
```

## Conversion attempt

```{r}
pdf_text("data-raw/2007-08-31-Salary-Information-Alphabetical.pdf")
```
