# MLS Salaries

This is a collection of MLS Salary data from the [MLS Players Association](https://mlsplayers.org/resources/salary-guide). They have published the data since 2007, but formats far widely. There are other challenges as well.

The code is public on [Github](https://github.com/utdata/rwd-mls-salaries). The published notebooks are on [Quarto Pub](https://christianmcdonald.quarto.pub/mls-salaries/).
