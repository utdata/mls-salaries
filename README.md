# MLS Salaries

This is a collection of MLS Salary data from the [MLS Players Association](https://mlsplayers.org/resources/salary-guide). They have published the data since 2007, but formats far widely. There are other challenges as well.

Various notebooks are available through the site navigation above. The main notebooks are [Cleaning](01-cleaning.qmd) and [Analysis 2023](02-analysis.qmd).

The code is public on [Github](https://github.com/utdata/rwd-mls-salaries). The published notebooks are on [Quarto Pub](https://christianmcdonald.quarto.pub/mls-salaries/).

### Things I want to learn

- Players that were paid the most
- Teams that spent the most
- Top spending teams over the past several years

### Future work

- Can I compare club spending to season results? This will require more data, so I'll explore packages.

## Resources

- I might want to look at [this research](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5b141b4a2714e53264a3db7d/t/5b14224703ce643a99571d4a/1528046159698/Goldberg_MLS_Salaries.pdf) from 2017.
